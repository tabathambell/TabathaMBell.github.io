# Tabatha Bell Portfolio using React

## Description
This is Tabatha Bell's portfolio deployed on Heroku. This project was a challenge for me based on learning from the modules as well as looking up my own tutorials on getting different things to work. While some was different than the explanations on the modules, I enjoyed challenging myself with React and learning different ways to do it. UseState was only used a few times as there was a lot I could do with Bootstrap, but a lot of React's implementation came from using NPM's specificially for React, including using Icons, the scroll feature for the Navbar, and implementing the contact page to actually send an Email using Emailjs.
